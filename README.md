# Cavitymoire
Cavitymoire is a package designed to analyze the light-matter interaction in cavity-mediated moir{\'e} superlattices. The main.py script is used to calculate results for fixed parameters, while the Bias_1c2.py, Bias_2c1.py, and Bias_2c1_2D.py scripts are utilized to perform calculations when the interlayer bias is varied.
